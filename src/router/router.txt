Single page application - 
So we send a initial request and we get back a empty html file and a vueJS bundle, 
this JS bundle mounts the app.vue on top of the html and then change the screen on it 


Why using Router-link and not anchor tag -
This is becuase vue, won't be able to do its prime work of not allowing 
the request to go to server, the anchor tag, is not caught by the vue router 
and the requrest is sent to server. 

What is this Histroy in createRouter?
So as we know vue is a single page application and it is hard for the browser to track what changes are made by JS.
Even though the page doesn't reload, the URL still needs to change to reflect the different 
views or states the user is in. The history in Vue Router handles this URL management. 
It ensures that the changes you make inside the app (by updating the content dynamically) 
are also reflected in the browser’s URL, so the user’s current state in the app is 
properly tracked and accessible. ( helps SPA to work like normal traditional web apps ).


createWebHistory() - 
this is the "clean" URL mode. When you use HTML5 history mode, 
the URLs look like regular web addresses without any extra # symbol.
Example URL: /about or /profile/123
These types of urls are very easy for Search enginers to understand ( Good SEO)

createWebHashHistory()-
the URL includes a # symbol to separate the actual page path from the routing part. 
This was used in older single-page apps before HTML5 support was more common.
Example URL: /about#profile or /home#section1
They don't use the latest HTML5 Histry API 
Browsers find it hard to read these URLs ( hence won't come up on top while searching )
